# Dental Wear Detection

This project analyzes dental mesh progression using artificial wear simulation and curvature/hausdorff metrics. Built for research and clinical exploration of cavity development.

### Features
- Mesh loading from OBJ files
- Artificial enamel wear simulation
- Curvature change & Hausdorff distance quantification
- Multi-patient pipeline 

### How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 dental_wear_pipeline.py
```
